      "I really enjoy learning languages &#127542; and I've been studying a lot of French and English the last couple of years, and I wanted to start learning a new language in 2020. However, I like to learn languages by immersion, in other words, by travelling &#128747; and living in places where people speak those language but the last year I could not travel, due to the pandemic, so my curiosity spiked and I started looking for &#127760; options to learn new things.",
      "That's how I came across with programming languages &#127756;. I realized that they aren't so different to traditional languages so I could dive into studying them using the same principle of immersion by building things &#127981;.",
      "In the process of learning to code, I started to meet other programmers and software developers, whom introduced me more into different web development communities and I felt awesome been around people that shared the same passion for learning &#129504; as me. That's when thanks to a friend &#128104;, made in the platzi's community for front-end development students, I realized that there were very good chances of pursuing a career as web developer &#128084;."
